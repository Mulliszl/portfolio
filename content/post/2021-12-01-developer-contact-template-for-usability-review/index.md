Hi <<name>>

I'm Zachary Mullis, and I run usability reviews of games which identify usability and UX issues that will prevent players from experiencing it the way you expect.

I saw your post looking for playters for <<game>>, and wondered if you would be interesting in a usability review for it. I will identify usability problems, and send you a report covering the top issues.

I wouldn't charge for the review, but I'd also be really interested in sharing this as a cast study on my portfolio/blog (https://mulliszl.netlify.app/). This might create some extra publicity for your game, so hopefully a positive for us both.

Let me know if you have any questions, and looking forward to chatting further.
