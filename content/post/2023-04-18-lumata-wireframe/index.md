# Executive Summary

The objective of this project was to develop the wireframe for a mobile application that serves as a cognitive aid for glaucoma patients as they adhere to a medicated eye drop regimen in hopes of slowing disease progression and maintaining eyesight. The application's core purpose is threefold: (1) to provide daily reminders to patients in keeping with their prescribed medication schedule, (2) to house both motivational and educational content that will encourage patients to adhere to their medication regimen, and (3) to connect patients with their care coordinators and provide valuable, relatively objective adherence data to care coordinators and medical professionals involved in the patients' treatment. To accomplish these objectives, several human factors psychology testing and analysis methods were employed to better understand the user, the task, and the system. User profiles were developed as a tool for understanding the core audience of this application and to help frame our efforts. Task analyses and heuristic analyses were conducted using existing medication tracker applications and a decision-action diagram was developed to support the creation of an initial wireframe. Additionally, a set of initial system requirements was outlined, categorized, and prioritized based on the needs of our sponsor and the scope of our timeline for the semester. These initial analyses were used in the development of our wireframe prototype, which would later be tested by a small sample of users from our target population.

The development of our wireframe prototype was a process structured by core guiding principles, including usability heuristics and accessibility principles specific to our target population of users. Rudimentary sketches of the app's interface, including home menus, settings menus, adherence tracking pages, and care coordinator communication channels were then formalized using Figma. Interactions between these formalized sketches were set up to allow for usability testing of the prototype using the 'wizard-of-oz' method. Usability testing involved developing a set of key tasks that users would be asked to perform, identifying metrics to quantify success and catastrophic failure, and creating an interview guide for post-hoc discussions with users about their experience with the wireframe. Usability testing was conducted with a small, convenience-based sample of users aged 22 - 74 (N = 5) and revealed several noteworthy design failures and pain points that should be addressed in future iterations of the wireframe. While some of the initial features were not found to work as intended, others were well-received by both younger and older users. All users provided valuable insights on the usability of the wireframe which were analyzed and built upon through the development of additional mockups and an analysis of future design considerations and research opportunities. This report highlights key learnings from each stage of the wireframing process, and it is our hope that the information obtained while developing and user testing this wireframe will provide meaningful insights that can be used by the Lumata Health team in the development of a mobile application that is beneficial for their patient population.
