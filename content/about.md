This is a test site that I will be using to learn and use as a portfolio. My personal and work projects will be posted on the main page, while the `Links` page will will direct you to projects, most of which will be school related.

I am using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package to create, customize, and manage this site. 

The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
