Executive Summary The objective of this project was to develop the wireframe for a mobile application that serves as a cognitive aid for glaucoma patients as they adhere to a medicated eye drop regimen in hopes of slowing disease progression and maintaining eyesight. The application&amp;rsquo;s core purpose is threefold: (1) to provide daily reminders to patients in keeping with their prescribed medication schedule, (2) to house both motivational and educational content that will encourage patients to adhere to their medication regimen, and (3) to connect patients with their care coordinators and provide valuable, relatively objective adherence data to care coordinators and medical professionals involved in the patients&#39; treatment.</description>

I saw your post looking for playters for &amp;laquo;game&amp;raquo;, and wondered if you would be interesting in a usability review for it. I will identify usability problems, and send you a report covering the top issues.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t charge for the review, but I&amp;rsquo;d also be really interested in sharing this as a cast study on my portfolio/blog (https://mulliszl.</description>

      <description>This will serve as a database to links to published bookdowns to avoid redundant copying of local files on my part. Most of these will be from school. I am in the process of converting these from private repositories to public or into pdfs.

      <description>This is a test site that I will be using to learn and use as a portfolio. My personal and work projects will be posted on the main page, while the Links page will will direct you to projects, most of which will be school related.
I am using the blogdown package to create, customize, and manage this site.
The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>
