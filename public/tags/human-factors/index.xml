Executive Summary The objective of this project was to develop the wireframe for a mobile application that serves as a cognitive aid for glaucoma patients as they adhere to a medicated eye drop regimen in hopes of slowing disease progression and maintaining eyesight. The application&amp;rsquo;s core purpose is threefold: (1) to provide daily reminders to patients in keeping with their prescribed medication schedule, (2) to house both motivational and educational content that will encourage patients to adhere to their medication regimen, and (3) to connect patients with their care coordinators and provide valuable, relatively objective adherence data to care coordinators and medical professionals involved in the patients&#39; treatment.</description>
